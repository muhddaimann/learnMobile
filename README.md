# 📱 LearnMobile – A Hands-On Mobile Development Playground

Welcome to **LearnMobile**, a fully responsive and theming-aware React Native app built with **Expo**, **TypeScript**, and **Material Design 3 (MD3)**.  
This project is my personal learning lab for mastering **mobile development** while experimenting with UI/UX principles, state management, dark mode, and clean architecture.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 **Light/Dark Mode Toggle** with full theme integration
- 🎨 **Custom Material Design 3 Color System**
- 🧱 **Reusable components** with clean styling via `react-native-paper`
- 📐 **Responsive design** powered by `react-native-responsive-screen`
- 📚 Structured with **Expo Router** and **Context API**
- ☁️ Simulated weather card, motivational quotes, and more UI experimentation
- ⚡ Built with performance and scalability in mind

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Deepen understanding of **React Native + Expo**
- Apply **design systems** using MD3 and custom themes
- Explore **navigation, layout**, and **device responsiveness**
- Experiment with **API integration, animations**, and advanced patterns (coming soon)

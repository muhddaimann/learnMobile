# 📱 LearnMobile – A Hands-On Mobile Development Playground

Welcome to **LearnMobile**, a fully responsive and theming-aware React Native app built with **Expo**, **TypeScript**, and **Material Design 3 (MD3)**.  
This project is my personal learning lab for mastering **mobile development** while experimenting with UI/UX principles, state management, dark mode, and clean architecture.
